# Route Builder
looks like this is more of a delivery manager

## A user should be able to do the following:
- Add ~~locations~~ delivery [x]
- View deliveries in list [x]
- View ~~locations~~ delivery locations on the ma
- Remove ~~locations~~ [x]
- Edit ~~location~~ delivery details [x]
- Create ordered lists of ~~locations~~ deliveries
- Share navigate to google map directions for a route

### Stretch goal
- Users who are driving a route should be able indicate they have finished a ~~location~~ delivery
  - Maybe they can leave comments about a ~~location~~ delivery?
